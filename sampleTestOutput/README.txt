This directory contains a sample test output from the 3 models tested, using the same prompt, as of OOct 20, 2024. 
    
    Extract texts from the image and return each text string in a new line.

The ouput varies based on the prompt used for the same model and also across the different models. 
It was observed chosing the right prompt could provide decent output, but some fine tuning will be required for the model to perform well.  Newer version of the model may also offer better performance.
